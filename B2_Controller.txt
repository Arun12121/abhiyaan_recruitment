At every interval of time, we can use the front and rear cameras to determine the 
current postion of the bot and compare it to the previous position and check whether 
the bot is going along the planned path.

Using the available data, we should predict the path of the dynamic obstacles 
and using this we can find the probability of an obstacle being pressent at 
a certain position in a certain instant of time. We can consider all the paths 
that have no stationary obstacles in them and then find probability of 
encountering an obstacle in all of them. Assign a certain weight to the distance 
of the path and to the probability of finding an obstacle and find the best path 
among them. We can keep repeating this process after say every 5 seconds for 
better accuracy.
